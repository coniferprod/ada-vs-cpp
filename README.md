# Ada vs. C++

This is a small collection of example programs from
"C++20 for Programmers: An Objects-Natural Approach"
by Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel (Pearson, 2022)
converted from C++ to Ada 2022.

The output from the programs is the same or very similar
as the original C++ programs found in the book's
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/pdeitel/CPlusPlus20ForProgrammers),
but the Ada versions aim to be idiomatic Ada.

For copyright reasons the C++ source code is not reproduced
here, but instead a link to the GitHub repository is provided.

# Compiling the Ada program text

All the Ada programs were compiled with GNATMAKE Community 2020.
